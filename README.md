# brokenbot-discord
A Discord bot using Discordie

To setup create a config.json file with your token in and edit the config variable in index.js to point to this. Create a data folder with an emotes.json file and a responses.json file. Under (emotes.json).emotes you should put a dictionary of emote names to their corresponding codes (get codes by typing \:EMOTE_NAME: in chat). You can also make arrays of related emotes. responses.json is not implemented yet.
